Hi there, Alexandria here! 


My background in nonprofit creation, project management, and operational cooordination equips me to translate complex data into strategic recommendations. 
I am known for creative problem solving, reliable execution, and high ethical standards when performing on and off the court. 
I am currently working on development and deployment of my data analysis skills and writing business requirements and user stories to apply in a role as a Business Analyst.
I am looking to collaborate on projects that drive meaningful change to clients and communities.

I love reading about health and weightloss strategies as well as immersing myself into the world and knowledge of business analysis. 

I can be reached at alexiscole643@gmail.com and www.linkedin.com/in/alexandria-smith1986.
